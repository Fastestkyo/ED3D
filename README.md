# ED3D: Transparent 3D Printer Display Concept

**ED3D** is a custom 3D printer project that integrates a transparent LCD screen in front of the build plate, allowing you to view a live 3D rendering of the print in progress. By hacking an old monitor and combining it with a Klipper-based setup, this project aims to bridge physical and digital printing with real-time visualization.

## Hardware

- **Display:**  
  Repurposing an old LG LCD monitor by removing its lcd thing and polarizing film to create a see-through screen effect. This enables the overlay of a virtual 3D model aligned with the physical print.

- **Controller + Computer:**  
  - **skr mini e3v3**   
  - **rpi4** running Klipper

##  FIRMWARE AND STUFF

- **firmware:** [Klipper](https://www.klipper3d.org/)
- **web ui:** [Mainsail](https://docs.mainsail.xyz/)

### TITLE

Klipper exposes a web API endpoint(moonraker):
http://<raspberrypi-ip>/printer/objects/query?print_stats

This provides details on the current print, including the `filename` of the G-code in progress.

You can access this file at:
/home/pi/print_data/gcodes/xyz.gcode

Use this path to visualize the G-code.

## IDEA

Goal: Real-time display of the currently printing 3D model using `three.js` or a browser-based G-code visualizer, rendered directly on the transparent screen.
