ED3D \
basically a printer with a screen showing the 3d model of what youre printing.

Rn i dont have a 3d printer and im pretty new to this.


MONITOR: 
Just removing the lcd and the polarizing film
Smtn like https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IhldXT7yxXo
I have some old lg lcd monitor which i'm gonna be using.

OTHER:
Using skr mini e3v3 and rpi4, with klipper. 

Using mainsail + klipper.

So after researching when you open http://<raspberrypi-ip>/printer/objects/query?print_stats
There is a filename which contains the file currently printing. So if we know the current printing file we can take it out of /gcodes. We can take the gcode file and display it using three.js or gcode visualizers.
Im pretty sure that there is a home/pi/print_data/gcode.
